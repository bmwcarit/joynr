%description
joynr is a web-based communication framework for Java, Javascript and C++
applications wanting to interact with other applications, no matter whether
they're deployed on consumer devices, vehicles, or backend infrastructure.

joynr makes writing distributed applications easy, as it:

* takes care of determining the most appropriate communication paradigm to
  talk with the desired end point

* provides a simple application programming interface to the joynr framework

* speeds up integration of new applications

... allowing you to focus on building your distributed application.
