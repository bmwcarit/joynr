# Overview
joynr is a web-based communication framework for Java, C++, and JavaScript applications
wanting to interact with other applications, no matter whether they're deployed on consumer
devices, vehicles, or backend infrastructure.

joynr makes writing distributed applications easy, as it:

* takes care of determining the most appropriate communication paradigm to talk with the desired
	end point
* provides a simple application programming interface to the joynr framework
* speeds up integration of new applications

... allowing you to focus on building your distributed application.
